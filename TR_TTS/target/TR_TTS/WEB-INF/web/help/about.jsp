<pre>
     Normal government Hospital is serving approximately 500 people in one day. That large 
     number of patients are coming to hospital due to their developments in recent past. But still 
      Hospitals are doing manual records keeping using various log books and formatted forms. So 
     the analysis and manual process are still inefficient. The circulation of paper among different 
     staffs like doctors, nurses, attendants, pharmacists has increased the stationary consumptions 
     and storage consumption in the hospitals. There are many delays, mistakes and lack of 
     accountability issues due to those manual process. Now the hospital management plans to 
     request for proposals from competent vendors to provide a proposal to implement a full 
     automated solution with minimum paper usage and address the problems stated above and 
     make the working environment ready for the future e-medicine with the 100% quality of 
     work in the hospital system.
